Interesting Matrixes:
1. Permutation matrix.
2. Elimation matrix.

vector space: linear combination of elements in the space still in the space.
subspace: vector space inside a vector space.
Is the union of two subspaces is still a vector space? No
Is the intersection of two subspaces is still a vector space? No

Column space: ALL linear combinations of column vectors.
Pivot columns: Independent columns.
Pivot variables:
Free columns: Cannot be determined
Free variables -> give special solutions by assign values freely:
n - r = # free variables.
Null space: All solutions of Ax = 0. (solutions always give a space)

Rank of a matrix: # of pivots
Reduced row echelon form (R) (rref) (Free part and Identity part)
Nullspace matrix
